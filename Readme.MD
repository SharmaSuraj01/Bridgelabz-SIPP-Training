Core Java Programming ‚Äì Bridgelabz ShipTraining
Welcome to the Core Java Programming repository for Bridgelabz ShipTraining! This project is designed to lead you from Java fundamentals to more advanced topics through practical exercises, real-world problems, and continuous learning. Whether you're new to Java or want to revisit advanced Java features, you'll find a pathway to grow your skills here.

üìö Project Structure
Arrays/
Solve array-based problems: searching, sorting, manipulation, and more.

Control-Flow/
Practice loops, conditionals, and fundamental control statements.

EXTRAS/
Explore bonus challenges like calculators, games, and number theory puzzles.

Java-Elements/
Understand basics: variables, data types, operators, conversions, and core concepts.

level-1/ & level-2/
Tackle progressive Java challenges as your skills advance.

Methods/
Dive deep into method-based tasks and modular programming concepts.

Strings/
Master string manipulation, searching, formatting, and related problems.

Each directory contains self-contained .java files focused on a specific concept and includes comments to guide your understanding.

üöÄ How This Repository Was Built
Organization: Topics are split into folders to help you progress naturally.

Problem-Driven: Every file targets a single problem, from basic arithmetic to complex operations.

Naming Convention: File names indicate the problem (example: Q1_VotingEligibility.java, Q40_BMICalculator.java).

Version Control: All work is tracked and managed in Git for transparent collaboration and easy contributions.

üõ† Setting Up Java on Your System
1. Download and Install JDK:

Get the latest JDK from the Oracle website or OpenJDK.

2. Set Up JAVA_HOME:

Windows

Edit system environment variables: add a JAVA_HOME variable pointing to your JDK.

Append %JAVA_HOME%\bin to your PATH.

Mac/Linux

Add the following to your .bashrc or .zshrc:

bash
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
3. Verify Installation:

Run:

text
java -version
javac -version
You should see your JDK version numbers.

üèÉ How to Run Any Java File
Use terminal/command prompt to navigate to a folder (e.g., Arrays/).

Compile the Java file:

text
javac FileName.java
Run the compiled class:

text
java FileName
(Exclude the .java extension when running.)

üíª How to Push Code to GitHub
Initialize Git (once per repo)

text
git init
Stage Your Files

text
git add .
Commit Changes

text
git commit -m "Describe your changes"
Connect to Remote Repo

text
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
Push to GitHub

text
git push -u origin main
